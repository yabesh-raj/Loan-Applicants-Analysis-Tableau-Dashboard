### Project Overview:

**Title:** Loan Applicant Analysis in India

**Objective:** This project aims to analyze a dataset of loan applicants in India using Tableau, deriving insights into the distribution of applicants across states, cities, age groups, and marital status. The analysis utilizes calculated fields, filters, actions, and various chart types to provide a comprehensive view of key trends in loan applications.

### Key Findings:

1. **Top and Bottom States:**
   - **Top 5 States:** Uttar Pradeh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, and Bihar have the highest number of loan applicants.
   - **Bottom 5 States:** Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Sikkim have the lowest number of loan applicants.

2. **Age Group Proportions:**
   - **Young Applicants:** Below 30 years constitute a significant proportion of applicants.
   - **Middle-aged Applicants:** Those between 30 and 50 years also show a considerable presence.
   - **Old Age Applicants:** Surprisingly, the old age group has the highest proportion of loan applicants, indicating potential financial needs in this demographic.

3. **Marital Status Impact:**
   - **Single Applicants:** Individuals with a single marital status exhibit a higher application rate, suggesting potential financial independence or specific financial needs in this group.

4. **City-wise Insights:**
   - **Top 5 Cities:** Vijayanagaram, Bhopal, Vijayawada, Saharsa, and Bhulandshahr are the cities with the highest number of loan applicants.
   - **Bottom 5 Cities:** Ujjain, Bettiah, Katni, Warangal, Karaikudi and other small cities show lower applicant numbers.

5. **Visualization Techniques:**
   - **Donut Chart:** Utilized for age group and marital status analysis to provide a clear visual representation of the distribution.
   - **Bar Charts:** Applied for city-wise analysis, offering a straightforward comparison between different locations.
   - **Map:** Used to visualize state-wise distribution, providing a geospatial understanding of the data.

### Conclusions:
